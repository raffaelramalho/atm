# Contributing

This repository uses GitHub pull requests for code review.

See [this primer](https://jrfom.com/posts/2017/03/08/a-primer-on-contributing-to-projects-with-git/)
for instructions on how to make contributions to the project.

If you're changing something non-trivial or user-facing, you may want to submit
an issue first.
